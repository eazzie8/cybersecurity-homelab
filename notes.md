# Week 1 – Day 1: Networking Lab

## Problem
While trying to access the internet from my Kali Linux VM, I noticed that `ping google.com` failed with:
Temporary failure in name resolution

However, `ping 8.8.8.8` worked fine, indicating that the network was connected but DNS resolution was failing.

## Diagnosis
1. Checked the network interface IP:
ip a

2. Verified routing:
ip route

3. Checked DNS configuration:
cat /etc/resolv.conf

Found `nameserver 192.168.159.2` (VMware NAT DNS), which was not responding initially.
4. Tried manually editing `/etc/resolv.conf` to use public DNS servers (8.8.8.8 and 1.1.1.1).
5. Configured NetworkManager to persist DNS changes using `nmcli`.

## Solution
- Ensured the network interface is using NAT in VMware.
- Used NetworkManager commands:
sudo nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" ipv4.ignore-auto-dns yes
sudo nmcli connection modify "Wired connection 1" ipv4.dns "8.8.8.8 1.1.1.1"
sudo nmcli connection down "Wired connection 1"
sudo nmcli connection up "Wired connection 1"

- Verified successful DNS resolution:
ping -c 3 google.com

Internet connectivity is now working properly.

## Lessons Learned
1. IP connectivity (`ping 8.8.8.8`) does not guarantee DNS is working.  
2. `/etc/resolv.conf` is often auto-generated by NetworkManager; direct edits may not persist.  
3. Understanding NetworkManager and VMware NAT behavior is crucial for troubleshooting lab networks.  
4. Troubleshooting real network issues teaches far more than just reading theory.

## Day 2 – Basic Router Connectivity Lab

Today I connected a PC to a router in Cisco Packet Tracer and tested connectivity.

At first, the link light was green, but the PC could not ping the router.  
After checking the router status, I noticed the interface had no IP address assigned.

I configured an IP address on the router interface and enabled it.  
After this, the PC was able to successfully ping the router.

### What I learned
- A green link does not always mean the network is working
- Router interfaces need an IP address to communicate
- Step-by-step troubleshooting is more important than memorizing commands
## Setup Phase – Packet Visibility
day 3-4
Initial days were spent setting up Wireshark and understanding how system activity translates into observable network traffic.
## Day 5 – DNS Traffic Analysis (Wireshark)

Today I focused only on DNS traffic using Wireshark.

I generated normal DNS queries (google.com, github.com) and observed:
- Short, readable domain names
- Successful A record responses
- Low query volume

Then I generated repeated failed DNS queries with random subdomains.
This made it clear how abnormal DNS patterns stand out.

Key takeaway:
DNS is not just name resolution — it is a major visibility and detection point in security operations.


## Day 6 – Network Traffic Analysis (Normal Traffic)

- Captured live network traffic using Wireshark
- Observed DNS resolution and ICMP packets
- Identified source and destination IP addresses
- Learned how normal user-generated traffic appears on the network
